# BMI Calculator

This project is a simple Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator implemented in Python. It demonstrates basic programming concepts such as variables, user input, functions, and control flow.

## Features
- Calculates BMI based on user input (weight and height)
- Provides BMI category according to standard ranges
- Easy to use and modify

## How BMI is Calculated
BMI is calculated using the formula:

    BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2

## BMI Categories
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 25
- Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 30
- Obesity: BMI ≥ 30

## Usage
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your weight in kilograms and height in centimeters when prompted.
3. The program will display your BMI and the corresponding category.
